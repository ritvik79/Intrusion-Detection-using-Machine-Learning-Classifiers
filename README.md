Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect network intrusions. It utilizes various classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels and Random Forest Classifier, to analyze network traffic and classify it as normal or an intrusion. The dataset used includes multiple attributes representing network activity, and models are trained to identify suspicious behavior.

Features
- Data Visualization – Scatter plots to visualize patterns in network traffic
- Data Splitting – Splits dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- SVM Classifiers – Uses Polynomial, Linear, and RBF kernels to classify intrusions
- Random Forest Classifier – Additional classifier to improve detection accuracy
- Model Evaluation – Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, classification reports, ROC & PRC curves to assess model performance
